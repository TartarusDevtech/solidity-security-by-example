# Solidity Security By Example

**Smart contract security** is one of the biggest impediments to the mass adoption of blockchain technology. This repository provides a series of practical examples focusing on Solidity smart contract security to educate and improve public knowledge in this crucial domain.

## Disclaimer

The smart contracts in this repository are used to demonstrate vulnerability issues only. **Some contracts are intentionally vulnerable, some are simplified for minimal reproduction, and some contain malicious code. Do not use the source code in this repository in your production applications.**
